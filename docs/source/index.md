We want to make sure that your journey with Robot Framework is a pleasant one.

So we are going to introduce you to our best practices when using Robot Framework.

Starting wih a **proper setup** for *development* and *debugging*, so things like    
- how to install Python and Robot Framework properly
- which IDE and Extensions to use
- how to write, run and debug your tests easily

We will also give you examples for different libraries and provide you some hints to find the right solution for your needs.

By the way - did you know that you can practice BDD or Data-Driven Testing with Robot Framework?

But writing tests is only the beginning. At some point you will want to **execute** them. Maybe from your **CI** system like  
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions

We're going to cover that as well.  
Also advanced things like re-running flaky tests - or avoiding them in the first place.

What about the integration with **other tools**, like reporting the test results to
- *Test Rail*
- *ALM*
- *Zephyr*
- *JIRA*?

Or did you know about other ways of reporting, like using Allure?

Did you know that parsing the results of your tests is really simple using the Robot Framework API?

Maybe you want to develop and release your own Robot Framework libraries at some point and want to know how to get started?
